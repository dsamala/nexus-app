# Nexus
Nexus is a social connectivity application that promotes connectivity with like-minded software developers. Its objective is to provide an "matching" user experience platform to developers of similar interest and expertise to foster collaboration. Websites like Github, Reddit, and StackOverflow are great resources for contributors and this application would be an accessory that capitalizes on communities like this scaled to a 1-1 relationship. Inspiration is drawn from dating apps and will be utilizing similar features and functionalities to these.
